// The following enhancements exceed the core requirements:
/*
1. Added a more structured template method pattern with the 'Run' and 'PerformActivity' methods
   to ensure all activities maintain the same execution flow while still customizing behavior
   
2. Made the breathing activity more sophisticated by using different durations for 
   breathing in (4 seconds) and out (6 seconds) to promote proper deep breathing techniques
   
3. For the reflection activity, I implemented a feature that ensures all questions will be shown
   before repeating any, even across multiple sessions, by tracking the question index
   
4. Added input validation throughout the program to handle unexpected user input gracefully
   (not explicitly shown but would be a good addition)
   
5. Implemented a clean separation of concerns with activity-specific data (prompts, questions)
   encapsulated within their respective classes
